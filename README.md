#Archlinux Package for Wuala

My suggestion to sanitiz the package:

- don't install stuff to ${HOME} as that depends on who's building
  the package

- adhere to the [archlinux java packaging
  guidelines](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Java_Package_Guidelines)


There's also a branch including the stuff in extra.
